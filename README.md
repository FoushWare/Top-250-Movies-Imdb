# Top 250 Movies on IMDb

## What i have done:

- Nextjs Api to fetch data from IMDb [All Movies,Eeach Movie] [Server Side ]

  - I used the Api Instead of calling it directly from the client side because of the rate limit of the Api and also to avoid the CORS error and Security issues

- Custom Hooks to fetch data from IMDb Api

- React Query to fetch data from IMDb Api [Client Side]

- React Player to play trailer of each movie

- Used React Router to navigate between pages

## How to run the project:

- Clone the project
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

- register to rapidapi.com and get your api key and add it to the .env file
